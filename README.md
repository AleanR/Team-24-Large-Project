# NitroPicks 🏈

> A UCF-exclusive sports prediction platform where students compete using virtual points — no real money, real stakes.

## What is NitroPicks?

NitroPicks lets UCF students place simulated bets on UCF athletic events using virtual betting credits. Winning bets convert credits into **Knight Points (KP)** — redeemable for real campus perks and discounts. The goal: make UCF athletics more engaging through friendly, competitive prediction.

## How It Works

### The Economy
Two virtual currencies power the platform:

| Currency | Purpose | How to Earn |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Betting Credits** | Place bets — no real value | 1,000 on signup · 800 per UCF ticket scanned |
| **Knight Points (KP)** | Redeem campus rewards | Win bets |

### Betting Flow
1. Browse open UCF sporting events
2. Choose a team and stake (min 10 credits, max 30% of balance)
3. Credits are deducted immediately — bet is **pending**
4. Odds lock at the moment the bet is placed
5. After the game, the admin declares a winner
6. Winners receive `stake × locked odds` in Knight Points · losers forfeit their stake

### Odds Model
Market-driven odds adjust in real time based on bet volume. Both teams start at even odds and shift as more bets come in — the more lopsided the betting, the higher the underdog's payout. A 10% house margin is applied to keep the system stable.

Betting closes **10 minutes before game start**. Cancelled or tied games refund all stakes.
